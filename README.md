A Tumblr theme based off of Undertale, a game that I've been obsessed with for a few weeks now.

[live demo](http://tumblr.thattacoguy.net)

###what it do 

 - make your tumblr page look like something ripped from the game
 - be super cool and load quickly thanks to CDNs and stuff
 - be open source

###what it don't
 
 - be mobile-ready, since tumblr provides a custom mobile experience anyway
 - give you a goat mom ;_;

###todo

 - [ ] provide better optimization for smaller viewports (as of right now, it only supports 1280x720 screens)
 * Issue: [#1](issues/1)
 - [x] redesign the UI to better reflect what Undertale actually looks like
